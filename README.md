# Risk Board Game
A Java based implementation of the board game known by the name of 'Risk' or 'Conquest'. This implementation offers a command line interaction to play the game and offers graphical representation to view the statistics of the ongoing game. 

This project was implemented to fulfil the requirements of the course 'Advanced Programming Practices(SOEN 6441)' offered at Concordia University, Montreal. 

## Architectural Design
The project is developed following the 'Model View Controller(MVC)' architecture. The architecture design document in available in the Documents folder.

## Project details
- Programming language: Java
- Documentation tool: Javadoc
- Testing framework: JUnit4
- VCS: Git

###### Software development methodology
The project was implemented following the 'Agile software development methodology'. The build sheets for each build is included in Documents directory along with the main project description.

###### Design patterns
Multiple design patterns were utilized in the project like Observer pattern to update the statistics of the game displayed in graphical representation as per the moves in the game, Adapter pattern to read/write files using different file formats of 'Domination' and 'Conquest' style maps, and Builder pattern for saving/loading the game. 

###### Coding standards
Consistent coding standards were maintained throughout the project. Standard Java conventions are followed throughout the project for naming, indenting, and project layout.
